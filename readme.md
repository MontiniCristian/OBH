The paper presents the Oceanic BeeHive (OBH) project, an idea that was conceived during the Nasa SpaceApps challenge 2019. It is an initial sketch of a project which aims to deploy a cellular network infrastructure for make internet connection available for cheap to all the ones who travel and live in the oceans. Unlike many pure space oriented alternatives for bringing internet connection in remote areas OBH is meant to be cheaper, it lays upon existing technologies as cellular networking and satellite communication.
